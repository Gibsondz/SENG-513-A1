                    League of Legends has 5 different types of roles that are part of the game.
                    This website was designed to provide brief descriptions of each role so you can 
                    make the informed choice about which role you should start playing when you play
                    the game. Below is a quick description of each to get you started. From there you
                    can use the tabs for more detailed descriptions.

                        make up for that in being able to crowd control enemies and heal/shield
                        teammates from damage.
